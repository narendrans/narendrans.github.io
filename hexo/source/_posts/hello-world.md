I have been using [GoDaddy][2] for more than 3 years to host my website and my blog. My homepage is just simple static content ([Bootstrap][1]). I used [Wordpress][6] for my blogging needs. A domain costs somewhere around 5-10 USD per year. A basic web hosting would cost anywhere between 20-30 USD per year. For the first year though you can get really cheap hosting and domain with the help of coupons. But from second year this becomes impossible. Most of the hosting sites are willing to give coupons of 75% off for new customers. With some googling you can get a new domain and hosting space for as little as 5-10 USD per year (for the first year)  
       
Here is what I was using for almost 4 years till now,
  
**Email**: [Google Apps Free Edition][5]  
**Domain**: [GoDaddy][2]  
**Hosting**: [GoDaddy][2] (Economy/Deluxe)  
**Blog**: [Wordpress][6]  
    
Now,  
    
**Email**: [Google Apps Free Edition][5]  
**Domain**: [GoDaddy][2]  
**Hosting**: [GitHub][3]  
**Blog**: [Hexo][4]  

The only reason why I am renewing this domain is because of Google Apps. With nearly 15 GB for an account and 50 accounts as the limit and with Google discontinuing free edition, I don't want to lose this. But spending money for hosting doesn't make any sense when you no longer make the most of it. Fortunately I still have [Azure][7] and [Google Cloud][8] credits that will be enough for a year. If they too run out, there is always Google AppEngine which has PHP support.
