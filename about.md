Software Engineer

Laziness and the satisfaction of automation are the two main things that drew me towards computer science and it continues to be so! I'm a full stack developer currently working for Denodo in New York. See below for resume and links.

Skydiver [Bragging?]

I won't claim to be adventurous, but falling from a plane seems to be the easiest way to experience heightened level of aliveness. I'm on the track to get my skydiving license and soon would like to do a HALO jump!

Backpacker

Travelling makes you more open minded. Living in a different country for the past few years and travelling to several other countries has given me some rich experiences.

Miscellaneous

I also like theoritical Physics, Politics, rock & hip-hop music, all movies directed by Nolan.
